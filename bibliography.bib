  abstract = {In learning field, each student has his own learning style that affects his way of get, process, understand and percept information. Determining the learning style of students enhances the performance of learning process. Two methods are commonly used to acquire student's learning style: static by questionnaire and dynamic by tracing student's navigation on e-learning environment. In this paper, a new approach to classify students dynamically depending on their learning style was proposed. This approach was experimented on 35 students for Data Structure online course created using Moodle. By extracting students' behavior, data from Moodle log, the learning style for each student was identified according to Felder and Silverman model. Also, learning style based on the behavior have been compared with a quiz results conducted at the end of the course. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve have been used to evaluate the quality of classification results comparing with quiz results. Good results with average accuracy of 76\% are achieved. Students' data have been divided into four training and testing sets with different splitting ratio. Different testing accuracy values are obtained for the different ratios using each dimension of Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM).},

  abstract = {Learning analytics is the analysis of electronic learning data which allows teachers, course designers and administrators of virtual learning environments to search for unobserved patterns and underlying information in learning processes. The main aim of learning analytics is to improve learning outcomes and the overall learning process in electronic learning virtual classrooms and computer-supported education. The most basic unit of learning data in virtual learning environments for learning analytics is the interaction, but there is no consensus yet on which interactions are relevant for effective learning. Drawing upon extant literature, this research defines three system-independent classifications of interactions and evaluates the relation of their components with academic performance across two different learning modalities: virtual learning environment (VLE) supported face-to-face (F2F) and online learning. In order to do so, we performed an empirical study with data from six online and two VLE-supported F2F courses. Data extraction and analysis required the development of an ad hoc tool based on the proposed interaction classification. The main finding from this research is that, for each classification, there is a relation between some type of interactions and academic performance in online courses, whereas this relation is non-significant in the case of VLE-supported F2F courses. Implications for theory and practice are discussed next.},

Initially, the work was based on somewhat static factors such as students' educational background and results from various questionnaires, while more recently, constantly accumulating data such as progress with course assignments and behavior in lectures has gained attention. We contribute to this work with results on early detection of students in need of assistance, and provide a starting point for using machine learning techniques on naturally accumulating programming process data. When combining source code snapshot data that is recorded from students' programming process with machine learning methods, we are able to detect high- and low-performing students with high accuracy already after the very first week of an introductory programming course. Comparison of our results to the prominent methods for predicting students' performance using source code snapshot data is also provided. This early information on students' performance is beneficial from multiple viewpoints. Instructors can target their guidance to struggling students early on, and provide more challenging assignments for high-performing students. Moreover, students that perform poorly in the introductory programming course, but who nevertheless pass, can be monitored more closely in their future studies.},

The study was carried out with 76\,second-year university students registered in a Computer Hardware course. The study aimed to answer two principle questions: which algorithms and features best predict the end of term academic performance of students by comparing different classification algorithms and pre-processing techniques and whether or not academic performance can be predicted in the earlier weeks using these features and the selected algorithm. The results of the study indicated that the kNN algorithm accurately predicted unsuccessful students at the end of term with a rate of 89\%. When findings were examined regarding the analysis of data obtained in weeks 3, 6, 9, 12,~and 14~to predict whether the end-of-term academic performance of students could be predicted in the earlier weeks, it was observed that students who were unsuccessful at the end of term could be predicted with a rate of 74\% in as short as 3\,weeks' time. The findings obtained from this study are important for the determination of features for early warning systems that can be developed for online learning systems and as indicators of student success. At the same time, it will aid researchers in the selection of algorithms and pre-processing techniques in the analysis of educational data.},

  abstract = {In today's world, large volumes of medical data are being continuously generated, but their value is severely undermined by our inability to translate them into knowledge and, ultimately, actions. Data mining techniques allow the extraction of previously unknown interesting patterns from large datasets, but their complexity limits their practical diffusion. Data-driven analysis is a multi-step process, in which health care professionals define analysis goals and assess extracted knowledge, while computer scientists tackle the non trivial task of driving the miner system analysis activity. This paper addresses the mining activity from a different perspective. We believe that mining systems should be able to devise which knowledge could be most interesting to users and extract actionable knowledge from large medical datasets, with minimal user intervention. More specifically, mining systems should be capable of (i) devising viable end-goals for a specific dataset (i.e., that yield actionable knowledge to the user and are feasible given the dataset characteristics and size), based on the expertise acquired during the analysis of previous datasets, and (ii) extracting a manageable set of knowledge. Automated data analysis should fuel the next generation of medical mining systems, thus enabling users to automatically mine massive data repositories.},

The number of predictors included in the regression model depends on many factors among which, historical data, experience, etc. At the end selection of most important predictors is something objective due to the researcher. Multicollinearity is a phenomena when two or more predictors are correlated, if this happens, the standard error of the coefficients will increase [8]. Increased standard errors means that the coefficients for some or all independent variables may be found to be significantly different from 0. In other words, by overinflating the standard errors, multicollinearity makes some variables statistically insignificant when they should be significant. In this paper we focus on the multicollinearity, reasons and consequences on the reliability of the regression model.},

This report summarizes the results of those discussions and nominations and serves as one vantage point on where our post-pandemic future may be headed.

We used the Moodle LMS during the period of one academic semester, collecting all the interactions between the students and the system. These data scales up to more than 33K records of interactions where we applied data mining tools following the procedure for data extraction, cleaning, feature identification and preparation. We then proceeded to the creation of automatic learning models based on decision trees, we assessed the models and validate the results by assessing the accuracy of the predictions using traditional metrics and draw our conclusions on the validity of the process and possible alternatives1.},

Previous work has identified social interactions in self-tracking as a crucial factor in motivating users to exercise. However, it is unclear how integrating fitness features into complex pre-existing social network affects users' fitness tracking practices and social interactions. In this research, we address this gap through a qualitative study of 32 users of WeRun--a fitness plugin of the widely adopted Chinese mobile social networking service WeChat. Our findings indicate that sharing fitness data with pre-existing social networks motivates users to continue self-tracking and enhances their existing social relationships. Nevertheless, users' concerns about their online personal images lead to challenges around privacy. We discuss how our study could advance understanding of the effects of fitness applications built on top of pre-existing social networks. We present implications for future social fitness applications design.},

Data from the student information system, learning management system and mobile applications were analyzed using eight different classification algorithms. Furthermore, data transformation and preprocessing techniques were carried out to reduce the features. Moreover, genetic search and principle component analysis were carried out to further reduce the features. Additionally, the CN2 Rule Inducer and multivariate projection can be used to assist faculty in interpreting the rules to gain insights into student interactions. The results showed that Random Forest accurately predicted successful students at the end of the class with an accuracy of 88.3\% with an equal width and information gain ratio.},

This knowledge can be used to inform decisions related to course and tool design and pedagogy, and to further engage students and guide those at risk of failure. This working group report provides an overview of the body of knowledge regarding the use of educational data mining and learning analytics focused on the teaching and learning of programming. In a literature survey on mining students' programming processes for 2005-2015, we observe a significant increase in work related to the field. However, the majority of the studies focus on simplistic metric analysis and are conducted within a single institution and a single course. This indicates the existence of further avenues of research and a critical need for validation and replication to better understand the various contributing factors and the reasons why certain results occur. We introduce a novel taxonomy to analyse replicating studies and discuss the importance of replicating and reproducing previous work. We describe what is the state of the art in collecting and sharing programming data. To better understand the challenges involved in replicating or reproducing existing studies, we report our experiences from three case studies using programming data. Finally, we present a discussion of future directions for the education and research community.},

  abstract = {Educational data mining and learning analytics promise better understanding of student behavior and knowledge, as well as new information on the tacit factors that contribute to student actions. This knowledge can be used to inform decisions related to course and tool design and pedagogy, and to further engage students and guide those at risk of failure. This working group report provides an overview of the body of knowledge regarding the use of educational data mining and learning analytics focused on the teaching and learning of programming. In a literature survey on mining students' programming processes for 2005-2015, we observe a significant increase in work related to the field. However, the majority of the studies focus on simplistic metric analysis and are conducted within a single institution and a single course. This indicates the existence of further avenues of research and a critical need for validation and replication to better understand the various contributing factors and the reasons why certain results occur. We introduce a novel taxonomy to analyse replicating studies and discuss the importance of replicating and reproducing previous work. We describe what is the state of the art in collecting and sharing programming data. To better understand the challenges involved in replicating or reproducing existing studies, we report our experiences from three case studies using programming data. Finally, we present a discussion of future directions for the education and research community.},

The data set comprises the students at the University of Oulu who were admitted to the Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering during years 2006\textendash 2015. This data set was cleaned at three different levels, which resulted in three differently processed data sets: one set is the original data set with only basic cleaning, the second has been cleaned out of the most obvious anomalies and the third has been systematically cleaned out of possible anomalies. Each of these data sets was used to build a Gradient Boosting Machine model that predicted the cumulative number of ECTS the students would achieve by the end of their second-year studies based on their first-year studies and the Matriculation Examination results. The effects of the cleaning on the model performance were examined by comparing the prediction accuracy and the information the models gave of the factors that might indicate a slow ECTS accumulation. The results showed that the prediction accuracy improved after each cleaning stage and the influences of the features altered significantly, becoming more reasonable.},

These tools generally provide some type of basic analytics and graphs about users' interaction in the course. However, they do not enable a varied set of Data Mining techniques to be applied, such as approaches for classification, clustering, or association. To address this issue, a new and freely available Moodle Data Mining tool, named MDM, has been proposed in this paper. The proposed tool eases the whole knowledge discovery process, including tasks such as selection, data pre-processing, and data mining from Moodle courses. The proposed MDM tool has been developed in PHP programming language, so it can be easily integrated into Moodle as a module for a specific course. Its main features and architecture are described in depth, and a tutorial is also provided as a practical way of using the MDM interface. Finally, some experimental results using a real-life sample dataset of mechanical engineering students are analyzed. \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The book begins with an introduction beyond the basics of SAS, illustrated with non-trivial, real-world, worked examples. It proceeds to SAS programming and applications, SAS graphics, statistical analysis of regression models, analysis of variance models, analysis of variance with random and mixed effects models, and then takes the discussion beyond regression and analysis of variance to conclude. Pedagogically, the authors introduce theory and methodological basis topic by topic, present a problem as an application, followed by a SAS analysis of the data provided and a discussion of results. The text focuses on applied statistical problems and methods. Key features include: end of chapter exercises, downloadable SAS code and data sets, and advanced material suitable for a second course in applied statistics with every method explained using SAS analysis to illustrate a real-world problem. New to this edition: " Covers SAS v9.2 and incorporates new commands " Uses SAS ODS (output delivery system) for reproduction of tables and graphics output " Presents new commands needed to produce ODS output " All chapters rewritten for clarity " New and updated examples throughout " All SAS outputs are new and updated, including graphics " More exercises and problems " Completely new chapter on analysis of nonlinear and generalized linear models " Completely new appendix Mervyn G.

These variables often depend on the context, for example, the course structure, how the activities are assessed or whether the course is entirely online or a blended course. To the best of our knowledge, a predictive model that can generalize well to many different types of courses using data available in the LMS does not currently exist in the learning analytics literature. In this study, early prediction of students at risk is tackled by training a number of neural networks to predict which students would likely submit their assignments on time based on their activity up to two days before assignments' due dates. Five different datasets that cover a total of 78 722 student enrolments in 5487 courses have been used in this study. In order to improve how well the neural networks generalize, our networks can perform different forms of feature engineering using course peers data. The different architectures of these networks have been compared to find the one with more predictive power. To validate the models trained from the networks, both new datasets and unseen examples extracted from the same datasets have been used for training. Our research show that adding contextual information results in better prediction accuracies and F1 scores. Our networks are able to give predictions with accuracies in the 67.46-81.63\% range and F1 scores in the 71.30-83.09\% range.},

Institutions have been spending thousands of dollars to implement these systems in a bid to improve the quality of education as well as increasing students' enrolments through distance and blended learning. However, the impact of these system on improving students' performance has been a popular subject of research in recent years. Studies have been relying on data from users' opinions and subjective interpretation through surveys to determine the effectiveness of LMS usage on students' learning performance. The use of such data is normally subject to the possibility of distortion or low reliability. Therefore, this study designed and developed Learning Analytics tool and used the tool to determine the causation between LMS usage and students' performance. Data from LMS log of two courses delivered at Mbeya University of Science and Technology (MUST) were extracted using developed Learning Analytics tool and subjected into linear regression analysis with students' final results. The study found that discussion posts, peer interaction, and exercises were determined to be significant factors for students' academic achievement in blended learning at MUST. Nonetheless, time spend in the LMS, number of downloads, and login frequency were found to have no significant impact on students' learning performance. The implications of these results on improving students' learning are discussed.},

  abstract = {Activity logs collected from wearable devices (e.g. Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc.) are a promising source of data to facilitate a wide range of applications such as personalized exercise scheduling, workout recommendation, and heart rate anomaly detection. However, such data are heterogeneous, noisy, diverse in scale and resolution, and have complex interdependencies, making them challenging to model. In this paper, we develop context-aware sequential models to capture the personalized and temporal patterns of fitness data. Specifically, we propose FitRec - an LSTM-based model that captures two levels of context information: context within a specific activity, and context across a user's activity history. We are specifically interested in (a) estimating a user's heart rate profile for a candidate activity; and (b) predicting and recommending suitable activities on this basis. We evaluate our model on a novel dataset containing over 250 thousand workout records coupled with hundreds of millions of parallel sensor measurements (e.g. heart rate, GPS) and metadata. We demonstrate that the model is able to learn contextual, personalized, and activity-specific dynamics of users' heart rate profiles during exercise. We evaluate the proposed model against baselines on several personalized recommendation tasks, showing the promise of using wearable data for activity modeling and recommendation.},

  abstract = {Participation in virtual communities of practice (vCoP) can be influenced at the same time by technology acceptance and by community factors. To overcome methodological issues connected with the analysis of these influences, learning analytics were applied. Based on a recent vCoP model, the collaborative dialogue comprising 4040 interventions in 1981 messages created by a vCoP located at a US American online university was automatically analyzed. The text-based asynchronous online discussions were scored using a cohesion-based participation and collaboration analysis. Additionally, a sample of N=133 vCoP participants responded a technology acceptance survey. Thus, a combined research model including the vCoP model and an established technology acceptance model was verified. The results confirmed the vCoP model entirely, and the acceptance model only partially. As consequence for educational research, the CoP model was confirmed and extended to vCoP settings, while the acceptance model appears to need reconsideration. For academic practice, the study initiates the development of assessment tools fostering knowledge sharing through dialogue in vCoP. Also, it suggests how virtual classrooms can be extended to open spaces where value creation takes place through social learning. Learning analytics proved thus successful, provides information that impacts both theory and practice of technology-enhanced learning.},

Both EDM and LA aim to understand learners and optimise learning processes. Predictive modelling serve a key role in optimising learning processes. Learning Analytics in an LMS covers many different aspects: finding students at risk of abandoning a course, predicting students failing a quiz or students not reaching the end of a lesson in less than 15 minutes. Thus, there are multiple prediction models that can be explored. The prediction models can target at the course also. For instance, will this course engage learners? Will this forum be useful to the students of this course? To ease the evaluation and usage of Supervised Learning prediction models in LMS, we abstract the key elements of prediction models and we build an analytics framework for Moodle, one of the most popular Learning management Systems available in the market. Our software framework manages the complete cycle that predictive models follow until they are used in production, which includes calculations of features and labels from the LMS database raw data, normalization, feature engineering, model evaluation and a production-ready mode to generate insights for users from predictions. Apart from the software framework we also present a use case that serves as an example: A prediction model which is able to identify students at risk of abandoning a course with a 92\% in accuracy using past versions of the course as training data.},

It constitutes an overview of empirical evidence behind key objectives of the potential adoption of LA/EDM in generic educational strategic planning. We examined the literature on experimental case studies conducted in the domain during the past six years (2008-2013). Search terms identified 209 mature pieces of research work, but inclusion criteria limited the key studies to 40. We analyzed the research questions, methodology and findings of these published papers and categorized them accordingly. We used non-statistical methods to evaluate and interpret findings of the collected studies. The results have highlighted four distinct major directions of the LA/EDM empirical research. We discuss on the emerged added value of LA/EDM research and highlight the significance of further implications. Finally, we set our thoughts on possible uncharted key questions to investigate both from pedagogical and technical considerations.}

  abstract = {The users of the World Wide Web produce data continuously. This happens in varied areas such as trading on line, product ratings, support and use of services, and many more, comprising Distance Education. The ever increasing amount of such data can make analysis and extraction of meaningful information progressively harder, and sophisticated analysis techniques are to be used to extract added value from data. Many companies do collection and analysis of data with the purpose to develop their marketing strategies. In the field of education, and Distance Education in particular, data collected through online Learning Management Systems (LMSs) can provide a great resource, and a strong challenge, for the analysis of learning processes, the design of training paths, and the updating and personalization of learning environments. While, on the one hand, there is an increasing demand by educational institutions to measure, demonstrate, and improve the results achieved in distance learning, on the other hand the logic of traditional reporting included in LMS platforms does not satisfy that growing need. Learning Analytics is the answer to the need for optimization of learning through the techniques of analysis of data produced by learning processes, involving all stakeholders of the system. In this paper we show and discuss a brief state of the art of models of Learning Analytics presented in the literature.},

This interest is motivated by the need to better understand teaching, learning, ?intelligent content,? and personalization and adaptation. While still in the early stages of research and implementation, several organizations (Society for Learning Analytics Research and the International Educational Data Mining Society) have formed to foster a research community around the role of data analytics in education. This article considers the research fields that have contributed technologies and methodologies to the development of learning analytics, analytics models, the importance of increasing analytics capabilities in organizations, and models for deploying analytics in educational settings. The challenges facing LA as a field are also reviewed, particularly regarding the need to increase the scope of data capture so that the complexity of the learning process can be more accurately reflected in analysis. Privacy and data ownership will become increasingly important for all participants in analytics projects. The current legal system is immature in relation to privacy and ethics concerns in analytics. The article concludes by arguing that LA has sufficiently developed, through conferences, journals, summer institutes, and research labs, to be considered an emerging research field.},

  abstract = {The field of learning analytics has the potential to enable higher education institutions to increase their understanding of their students' learning needs and to use that understanding to positively influence student learning and progression. Analysis of data relating to students and their engagement with their learning is the foundation of this process. There is an inherent assumption linked to learning analytics that knowledge of a learner's behavior is advantageous for the individual, instructor, and educational provider. It seems intuitively obvious that a greater understanding of a student cohort and the learning designs and interventions they best respond to would benefit students and, in turn, the institution's retention and success rate. Yet collection of data and their use face a number of ethical challenges, including location and interpretation of data; informed consent, privacy, and deidentification of data; and classification and management of data. Approaches taken to understand the opportunities and ethical challenges of learning analytics necessarily depend on many ideological assumptions and epistemologies. This article proposes a sociocritical perspective on the use of learning analytics. Such an approach highlights the role of power, the impact of surveillance, the need for transparency, and an acknowledgment that student identity is a transient, temporal, and context-bound construct. Each of these affects the scope and definition of learning analytics' ethical use. We propose six principles as a framework for considerations to guide higher education institutions to address ethical issues in learning analytics and challenges in context-dependent and appropriate ways.},

This study is based on the analysis of 252 papers on learning analytics in higher education published between 2012 and 2018. The main research question is: What is the current scientific knowledge about the application of learning analytics in higher education? The focus is on research approaches, methods and the evidence for learning analytics. The evidence was examined in relation to four earlier validated propositions: whether learning analytics i) improve learning outcomes, ii) support learning and teaching, iii) are deployed widely, and iv) are used ethically. The results demonstrate that overall there is little evidence that shows improvements in students' learning outcomes (9\%) as well as learning support and teaching (35\%). Similarly, little evidence was found for the third (6\%) and the forth (18\%) proposition. Despite the fact that the identified potential for improving learner practice is high, we cannot currently see much transfer of the suggested potential into higher educational practice over the years. However, the analysis of the existing evidence for learning analytics indicates that there is a shift towards a deeper understanding of students' learning experiences for the last years.},

This paper focuses on work conducted at the Open University (OU) into predicting students who are at risk of failing their module. The Open University is one of the worlds largest distance learning institutions. Since tutors do not interact face to face with students, it can be difficult for tutors to identify and respond to students who are struggling in time to try to resolve the difficulty. Predictive models have been developed and tested using historic Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) activity data combined with other data sources, for three OU modules. This has revealed that it is possible to predict student failure by looking for changes in user's activity in the VLE, when compared against their own previous behaviour, or that of students who can be categorised as having similar learning behaviour. More focused analysis of these modules applying the GUHA (General Unary Hypothesis Automaton) method of data analysis has also yielded some early promising results for creating accurate hypothesis about students who fail.},

Most current prediction models are difficult for teachers to interpret. This poses significant problems for model use (e.g. personalizing education and intervention) as well as model evaluation. In this paper, we synthesize learning analytics approaches, educational data mining (EDM) and HCI theory to explore the development of more usable prediction models and prediction model representations using data from a collaborative geometry problem solving environment: Virtual Math Teams with Geogebra (VMTwG). First, based on theory proposed by Hrastinski (2009) establishing online learning as online participation, we operationalized activity theory to holistically quantify students' participation in the CSCL (Computer-supported Collaborative Learning) course. As a result, 6 variables, Subject, Rules, Tools, Division of Labor, Community, and Object, are constructed. This analysis of variables prior to the application of a model distinguishes our approach from prior approaches (feature selection, Ad-hoc guesswork etc.). The approach described diminishes data dimensionality and systematically contextualizes data in a semantic background. Secondly, an advanced modeling technique, Genetic Programming (GP), underlies the developed prediction model. We demonstrate how connecting the structure of VMTwG trace data to a theoretical framework and processing that data using the GP algorithmic approach outperforms traditional models in prediction rate and interpretability. Theoretical and practical implications are then discussed.},
