  abstract = {Learning analytics is the analysis of electronic learning data which allows teachers, course designers and administrators of virtual learning environments to search for unobserved patterns and underlying information in learning processes. The main aim of learning analytics is to improve learning outcomes and the overall learning process in electronic learning virtual classrooms and computer-supported education. The most basic unit of learning data in virtual learning environments for learning analytics is the interaction, but there is no consensus yet on which interactions are relevant for effective learning. Drawing upon extant literature, this research defines three system-independent classifications of interactions and evaluates the relation of their components with academic performance across two different learning modalities: virtual learning environment (VLE) supported face-to-face (F2F) and online learning. In order to do so, we performed an empirical study with data from six online and two VLE-supported F2F courses. Data extraction and analysis required the development of an ad hoc tool based on the proposed interaction classification. The main finding from this research is that, for each classification, there is a relation between some type of interactions and academic performance in online courses, whereas this relation is non-significant in the case of VLE-supported F2F courses. Implications for theory and practice are discussed next.},

The study was carried out with 76\,second-year university students registered in a Computer Hardware course. The study aimed to answer two principle questions: which algorithms and features best predict the end of term academic performance of students by comparing different classification algorithms and pre-processing techniques and whether or not academic performance can be predicted in the earlier weeks using these features and the selected algorithm. The results of the study indicated that the kNN algorithm accurately predicted unsuccessful students at the end of term with a rate of 89\%. When findings were examined regarding the analysis of data obtained in weeks 3, 6, 9, 12,~and 14~to predict whether the end-of-term academic performance of students could be predicted in the earlier weeks, it was observed that students who were unsuccessful at the end of term could be predicted with a rate of 74\% in as short as 3\,weeks' time. The findings obtained from this study are important for the determination of features for early warning systems that can be developed for online learning systems and as indicators of student success. At the same time, it will aid researchers in the selection of algorithms and pre-processing techniques in the analysis of educational data.},

  abstract = {In today's world, large volumes of medical data are being continuously generated, but their value is severely undermined by our inability to translate them into knowledge and, ultimately, actions. Data mining techniques allow the extraction of previously unknown interesting patterns from large datasets, but their complexity limits their practical diffusion. Data-driven analysis is a multi-step process, in which health care professionals define analysis goals and assess extracted knowledge, while computer scientists tackle the non trivial task of driving the miner system analysis activity. This paper addresses the mining activity from a different perspective. We believe that mining systems should be able to devise which knowledge could be most interesting to users and extract actionable knowledge from large medical datasets, with minimal user intervention. More specifically, mining systems should be capable of (i) devising viable end-goals for a specific dataset (i.e., that yield actionable knowledge to the user and are feasible given the dataset characteristics and size), based on the expertise acquired during the analysis of previous datasets, and (ii) extracting a manageable set of knowledge. Automated data analysis should fuel the next generation of medical mining systems, thus enabling users to automatically mine massive data repositories.},

We used the Moodle LMS during the period of one academic semester, collecting all the interactions between the students and the system. These data scales up to more than 33K records of interactions where we applied data mining tools following the procedure for data extraction, cleaning, feature identification and preparation. We then proceeded to the creation of automatic learning models based on decision trees, we assessed the models and validate the results by assessing the accuracy of the predictions using traditional metrics and draw our conclusions on the validity of the process and possible alternatives1.},

  abstract = {This thesis is focused on the preprocessing and challenges of a university student data set and how different levels of data preprocessing affect the performance of a prediction model both in general and in selected groups of interest. The data set comprises the students at the University of Oulu who were admitted to the Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering during years 2006\textendash 2015. This data set was cleaned at three different levels, which resulted in three differently processed data sets: one set is the original data set with only basic cleaning, the second has been cleaned out of the most obvious anomalies and the third has been systematically cleaned out of possible anomalies. Each of these data sets was used to build a Gradient Boosting Machine model that predicted the cumulative number of ECTS the students would achieve by the end of their second-year studies based on their first-year studies and the Matriculation Examination results. The effects of the cleaning on the model performance were examined by comparing the prediction accuracy and the information the models gave of the factors that might indicate a slow ECTS accumulation. The results showed that the prediction accuracy improved after each cleaning stage and the influences of the features altered significantly, becoming more reasonable.},

These tools generally provide some type of basic analytics and graphs about users' interaction in the course. However, they do not enable a varied set of Data Mining techniques to be applied, such as approaches for classification, clustering, or association. To address this issue, a new and freely available Moodle Data Mining tool, named MDM, has been proposed in this paper. The proposed tool eases the whole knowledge discovery process, including tasks such as selection, data pre-processing, and data mining from Moodle courses. The proposed MDM tool has been developed in PHP programming language, so it can be easily integrated into Moodle as a module for a specific course. Its main features and architecture are described in depth, and a tutorial is also provided as a practical way of using the MDM interface. Finally, some experimental results using a real-life sample dataset of mechanical engineering students are analyzed. \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The book begins with an introduction beyond the basics of SAS, illustrated with non-trivial, real-world, worked examples. It proceeds to SAS programming and applications, SAS graphics, statistical analysis of regression models, analysis of variance models, analysis of variance with random and mixed effects models, and then takes the discussion beyond regression and analysis of variance to conclude. Pedagogically, the authors introduce theory and methodological basis topic by topic, present a problem as an application, followed by a SAS analysis of the data provided and a discussion of results. The text focuses on applied statistical problems and methods. Key features include: end of chapter exercises, downloadable SAS code and data sets, and advanced material suitable for a second course in applied statistics with every method explained using SAS analysis to illustrate a real-world problem. New to this edition: " Covers SAS v9.2 and incorporates new commands " Uses SAS ODS (output delivery system) for reproduction of tables and graphics output " Presents new commands needed to produce ODS output " All chapters rewritten for clarity " New and updated examples throughout " All SAS outputs are new and updated, including graphics " More exercises and problems " Completely new chapter on analysis of nonlinear and generalized linear models " Completely new appendix Mervyn G.

Institutions have been spending thousands of dollars to implement these systems in a bid to improve the quality of education as well as increasing students' enrolments through distance and blended learning. However, the impact of these system on improving students' performance has been a popular subject of research in recent years. Studies have been relying on data from users' opinions and subjective interpretation through surveys to determine the effectiveness of LMS usage on students' learning performance. The use of such data is normally subject to the possibility of distortion or low reliability. Therefore, this study designed and developed Learning Analytics tool and used the tool to determine the causation between LMS usage and students' performance. Data from LMS log of two courses delivered at Mbeya University of Science and Technology (MUST) were extracted using developed Learning Analytics tool and subjected into linear regression analysis with students' final results. The study found that discussion posts, peer interaction, and exercises were determined to be significant factors for students' academic achievement in blended learning at MUST. Nonetheless, time spend in the LMS, number of downloads, and login frequency were found to have no significant impact on students' learning performance. The implications of these results on improving students' learning are discussed.},

  abstract = {Participation in virtual communities of practice (vCoP) can be influenced at the same time by technology acceptance and by community factors. To overcome methodological issues connected with the analysis of these influences, learning analytics were applied. Based on a recent vCoP model, the collaborative dialogue comprising 4040 interventions in 1981 messages created by a vCoP located at a US American online university was automatically analyzed. The text-based asynchronous online discussions were scored using a cohesion-based participation and collaboration analysis. Additionally, a sample of N=133 vCoP participants responded a technology acceptance survey. Thus, a combined research model including the vCoP model and an established technology acceptance model was verified. The results confirmed the vCoP model entirely, and the acceptance model only partially. As consequence for educational research, the CoP model was confirmed and extended to vCoP settings, while the acceptance model appears to need reconsideration. For academic practice, the study initiates the development of assessment tools fostering knowledge sharing through dialogue in vCoP. Also, it suggests how virtual classrooms can be extended to open spaces where value creation takes place through social learning. Learning analytics proved thus successful, provides information that impacts both theory and practice of technology-enhanced learning.},

This support generally focuses on an improved self-awareness based on the review of own fitness data, sometimes enhanced by social features like performance comparison. We see a demand for a goal-driven support of fitness goal achievement to be addressed by a digital coach. The digital coach identifies strength and weaknesses of the subject, generates a training plan, motivates and helps, just like a real coach. Such a digital coach will highly benefit from the activity tracking system data which is used to personalize the training plan based on performed activities.},

  abstract = {The users of the World Wide Web produce data continuously. This happens in varied areas such as trading on line, product ratings, support and use of services, and many more, comprising Distance Education. The ever increasing amount of such data can make analysis and extraction of meaningful information progressively harder, and sophisticated analysis techniques are to be used to extract added value from data. Many companies do collection and analysis of data with the purpose to develop their marketing strategies. In the field of education, and Distance Education in particular, data collected through online Learning Management Systems (LMSs) can provide a great resource, and a strong challenge, for the analysis of learning processes, the design of training paths, and the updating and personalization of learning environments. While, on the one hand, there is an increasing demand by educational institutions to measure, demonstrate, and improve the results achieved in distance learning, on the other hand the logic of traditional reporting included in LMS platforms does not satisfy that growing need. Learning Analytics is the answer to the need for optimization of learning through the techniques of analysis of data produced by learning processes, involving all stakeholders of the system. In this paper we show and discuss a brief state of the art of models of Learning Analytics presented in the literature.},

Novel ways to deal with fitness data patterns are emerging because of advances in (1) Fitness knowledge discovery (2) Fitness data representation and (3) Behavioral and psychological aspects in mining [1]. We propose a health data analytics framework - `S Fit' that aggregates ontology-based fitness knowledge and user generated health data to extract patterns. These patterns are generated considering psychological, behavioral, and physiological traits of a user. In the process, `Healthification' of all applications on the mobile phone is realized in terms of personalization of existing features, addition of new features and providing unique user experience.},

  abstract = {Recently, learning analytics (LA) has drawn the attention of academics, researchers, and administrators. This interest is motivated by the need to better understand teaching, learning, ?intelligent content,? and personalization and adaptation. While still in the early stages of research and implementation, several organizations (Society for Learning Analytics Research and the International Educational Data Mining Society) have formed to foster a research community around the role of data analytics in education. This article considers the research fields that have contributed technologies and methodologies to the development of learning analytics, analytics models, the importance of increasing analytics capabilities in organizations, and models for deploying analytics in educational settings. The challenges facing LA as a field are also reviewed, particularly regarding the need to increase the scope of data capture so that the complexity of the learning process can be more accurately reflected in analysis. Privacy and data ownership will become increasingly important for all participants in analytics projects. The current legal system is immature in relation to privacy and ethics concerns in analytics. The article concludes by arguing that LA has sufficiently developed, through conferences, journals, summer institutes, and research labs, to be considered an emerging research field.},

  abstract = {Building a student performance prediction model that is both practical and understandable for users is a challenging task fraught with confounding factors to collect and measure. Most current prediction models are difficult for teachers to interpret. This poses significant problems for model use (e.g. personalizing education and intervention) as well as model evaluation. In this paper, we synthesize learning analytics approaches, educational data mining (EDM) and HCI theory to explore the development of more usable prediction models and prediction model representations using data from a collaborative geometry problem solving environment: Virtual Math Teams with Geogebra (VMTwG). First, based on theory proposed by Hrastinski (2009) establishing online learning as online participation, we operationalized activity theory to holistically quantify students' participation in the CSCL (Computer-supported Collaborative Learning) course. As a result, 6 variables, Subject, Rules, Tools, Division of Labor, Community, and Object, are constructed. This analysis of variables prior to the application of a model distinguishes our approach from prior approaches (feature selection, Ad-hoc guesswork etc.). The approach described diminishes data dimensionality and systematically contextualizes data in a semantic background. Secondly, an advanced modeling technique, Genetic Programming (GP), underlies the developed prediction model. We demonstrate how connecting the structure of VMTwG trace data to a theoretical framework and processing that data using the GP algorithmic approach outperforms traditional models in prediction rate and interpretability. Theoretical and practical implications are then discussed.},
